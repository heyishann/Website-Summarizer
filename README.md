# Website-Summarizer
Developed a Python-based website summarizer that takes a URL as input and generates a word cloud of the site's content on one side and a collage of the images used on the site on the other. The project utilizes Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Matplotlib for visualization, and WordCloud for generating keyword clouds
